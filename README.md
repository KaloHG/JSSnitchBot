# JSSnitchBot
A basic snitch bot for Civ Servers that are newer than the 1.14 update.

## Setup
Clone this repo into a server, and start out by typing "npm install" into your command line. This will automatically install dependencies. If you do not have NodeJS
installed, make sure to install the "Current" version at https://nodejs.org/en/ (17.+)

Once done fill out all of the respective lines such as the bot token and mc username/email and pass in the index.js file. Finally, run "node index.js" in your command
line within the folder that contains index.js for this file. Happy snitching!
